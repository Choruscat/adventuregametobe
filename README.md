# WIP Adventure Game by Choruscat
##Hi! Nice to meet you.
We're Choruscat, an indie game dev group, and we're creating a text-based adventure game in Python based on games such as the Shin Megami Tensei series and Undertale, with influences from VA-11 Hall-A and Papers, Please.
We don't know what it's about, and we only barely know how we plan on doing it.
However, with our determination and limited knowledge of game design, we know that it's going to happen!

The game will be written in Osmium Engine, an engine written by lead developer ANT1H3R0 for the purpose of creating this game.
During the creation of Osmium Engine, an accompanying game will be created by the name of "Bill Gates Adventure."
This game will tell the tale of a hero accompanying Bill Gates in his quest to donate money and sell Windows 11 around the world.
Here's some concept art for that game:

This image is of a very early concept featuring a simpler version of the Osmium Engine UI that would alow the user to input any command they wished. Command output would be rendered below the graphic for the scene.

![Current Concept](https://github.com/Choruscat/adventuregametobe/blob/master/assets/art/concept/billgatesinvalhalla.png)
This image portrays the current concept that the engine will be based around, which will feature a more limited and straightforward system of input based around a set of directional arrows and buttons. Command output is rendered in a larger area below the graphic, which has been enlarged as well. Button text will change with the context of the scene; for example, two buttons outside of combat might read "examine" and "inventory."
